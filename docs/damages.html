Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility. The version displayed above was the version of the Git repository at the time these results were generated. <br><br> Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  docs/

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   .gitignore

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

Some of these roads included Highway 90 at Highway 36 and Lane Drive, Lane Drive at Mustang Road and I-69 at FM 762 and Reading Road. Major record level flooding of both the Brazos and San Bernard Rivers caused significant home flooding from Richmond to Rosharon. Massive flooding occurred in Tierra Grande subdivision along the San Bernard River in southwestern Fort Bend County. Home flooding occurred at Valley Lodge in Simonton, along Edgewood and Baudet Roads in Richmond, along Bar, Barker, Cumings, Sixth Street, Avenue B and Rio Brazos Roads in Rosenberg. Sections of FM 2759 as well as the Grand River, Rivers Edge and Pecan Estates in Thompsons flooded. Many countywide roads became inundated in flood waters including, but not limited to, Highway 90A, Pitts Road, FM 1489, FM 723, FM 1093, FM 359, SH 6 feeder roads, Sienna Parkway, Carrol Road, McKeever Road, Knights Court, Miller Road, river Oaks Road, Thompsons Ferry Road, Strange Drive, Greenwood Drive, Second Street and low lying roads in Quail Valley in Missouri City.  Due to record pool levels in Barker Reservoir, homes in Cinco Ranch flooded. Big Creek flooding in Needville caused the flooding of homes on Ansel Road. Flooding being reported in or within homes in Missouri City with water rescues being conducted off of the Westpark Tollway in the Jeanetta Sharpstown area.",null,"Tropical Storm Harvey brought heavy rains and catastrophic flooding to portions of Montgomery County. There were 4 storm related fatalities, 3 direct. Record pool elevations at Lake Conroe led to record releases. Major record flooding occurred along the San Jacinto River and tributaries.","Tropical Storm Harvey brought heavy rains and catastrophic flooding to portions of Montgomery County. There were 5 storm related fatalities, 3 direct.  Major record flooding occurred along the San Jacinto River and tributaries. Water was reported over sections of I-45 northbound where TXDOT reported flooding at the FM 1097 intersection. Water was reported over sections of I-45 northbound where TXDOT reported flooding at the FM 1097 intersection. Record pool levels on Lake Conroe required downstream releases that flooded numerous downstream homes, businesses and vehicles. Major flooding occurred along the San Jacinto River and the east Fork of the San Jacinto and its tributaries inundated tens to hundreds of residential subdivisions. There were hundreds of flooded homes along Lake, Spring, Peach and Caney Creeks. There were impassable roads due to high water at Horseshoe Circle and Painted Blvd off the Grand Parkway, 19000 block of David Memorial from Sam's Club to Shenandoah Park, the 11000 block of River Oaks Drive, the 45 northbound lanes at Highway 242 and Hines Road in Willis. Flash flooding led to numerous road closures including FM149, FM1484, FM1485, FM1486, FM1774, FM2090 SH105 and others."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>EVENT_ID<\/th>\n      <th>STATE<\/th>\n      <th>YEAR<\/th>\n      <th>EVENT_TYPE<\/th>\n      <th>DAMAGE_PROPERTY<\/th>\n      <th>EVENT_NARRATIVE<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":[0,2]}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

The storm then weakened to a tropical storm and slowed,  looping back and tracking over SE Texas then back over the Gulf of Mexico making a second landfall along the Louisiana coast during the early morning hours of August 30th. Over that 5 day period over Southeast Texas TS Harvey produced catastrophic flooding with a large area of 30 to 60 inches of rain, 23 tornadoes, tropical storm force winds and a moderate storm surge near Matagorda Bay.  In some of the heavier bands rain fell at a rate of over 5 inches per hour. This copious record amount of rain over a  led to catastrophic flooding. Thousands of homes, businesses, and roads were flooded due to flash flooding and sheet flow from long duration intense rain. Main stem rivers and adjoining tributaries, creeks and bayous reached full capacity and came out of their banks and this also contributed to the massive flooding across southeastern Texas.","Storm surge damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locationsPost storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.","Post Tropical Storm Sandy was the costliest natural disaster by far in the state of New Jersey. Record breaking high tides and wave action combined with sustained winds as high as 60 to 70 mph with wind gusts as high as around 90 mph to batter the state. Statewide, Sandy caused an estimated 29.4 billion dollars in damage, destroyed or significantly damaged 30,000 homes and businesses, affected 42,000 additional structures and was responsible directly or indirectly for 38 deaths. A new temporary inlet formed in Mantaloking (Ocean County) where some homes were swept away. About 2.4 million households in the state lost power. It would take two weeks for power to be fully restored to homes and businesses that were inhabitable. In the Mount Holly warning and forecast area of New Jersey, Sandy was responsible for 24 deaths, 8 that are considered directly caused by the system: two drownings, five people killed by fallen trees and one person was blown over by the wind. Hardest hit were the coastal areas of Ocean and Monmouth Counties. As of late December, complete access to the barrier islands of Ocean County was still prohibited. It was expected to take until 2013 before rebuilt gas lines as well as the shore division of New Jersey Transit would be in operation. Approximately 230,000 residents of the state have applied for assistance from FEMA.||Tropical Storm Sandy formed in the Caribbean Sea on the 22nd of October. After drifting slowly southwest into the 23rd, Sandy turned to the north and intensified to a hurricane on the 24th just before making landfall in Jamaica during that afternoon. Hurricane Sandy continued to the north and intensified to a strong category two hurricane before making landfall again in Cuba shortly after Midnight EDT on the 25th. Hurricane Sandy emerged on the other side of Cuba during the morning of the 25th and proceeded to drift northwest as a category one or two hurricane as it moved through the Bahamas on the 25th and 26th. Overnight on the 26th, Hurricane Sandy (Category 1) started to move toward the north-northeast, a motion that continued into the evening of the 28th. From there, Sandy���s motion became driven by two factors. An anomalously strong blocking ridge over the Canadian Maritimes prevented Sandy from escaping to the east. Simultaneously, an approaching and deepening extratropical trough was about to capture Sandy. The combination of the two, turned Sandy to the north overnight on the 28th and then to the northwest on the 29th. Hurricane Sandy received one last jolt of tropical energy as it passed across the Gulf Stream during the morning of the 29th. The lowest recorded central pressure of 940 millibars (27.76 inches) occurred when Category 1 Hurricane Sandy was about 110 miles southeast of Atlantic City at 2 p.m. EDT on the 29th. As Sandy continued to move northwest and interact with the mid latitude trough, its interaction continued to make it less tropical, but did not weaken it much. Sandy continued to make a harder turn to the left (west) and made landfall in Atlantic County as a post tropical storm in Brigantine City just north of Atlantic City at 730 p.m. EDT on the 29th. The estimated minimum central pressure was 945 millibars. The lowest recorded central pressure was 945.6 millibars at the Atlantic City Marina at 734 p.m. EDT. From there, Sandy continued to weaken or fill as it moved west. At 9 p.m. EDT, the low pressure system was in western Atlantic County and continued to move west-northwest. At 11 p.m. EDT, the post tropical storm (about 954 millibars) was located in southern Chester County. Post tropical storm Sandy continued to move west-northwest and weaken. At 2 a.m. EDT on the 30th, the 962 millibar low was located near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and at 8 a.m. EDT the 979 millibar low was near Altoona, Pennsylvania. From there, the rapidly weakening low pressure system moved northwest and reached Lake Erie (993 millibars) at 8 p.m. EDT that evening and from there drifted north into Canada.||Direct deaths caused by Sandy included: a 43-year-old Hunterdon County man in Asbury (Franklin Township) that was killed when a tree fell on him, a 61-year-old male in Princeton (Mercer County) was struck and killed by a tree while clearing his driveway of other trees, a 58-year-old male who was blown over by the wind and died in a parking lot in Hamilton Township (Mercer County), a 54-year-old male and his 48-year-old wife died after a tree landed on their pick-up truck as they were exiting it in Mendham Township (Morris County), their two children were also injured, a 51-year-old male was killed in Jefferson Township (Morris County) when a tree fell into his house, a 61-year-old male drowned in his house on Vanders Drive by the Kettle Creek in Brick Township (Ocean County) and a 72-year-old male drowned in the Mystic Island section of Little Egg Harbor Township (Ocean County). Both drownings were on the mainland side of Ocean County west of Barnegat Bay.||Other deaths that were attributed to Sandy included a 65-year-old woman who died of a heart attack while on an evacuation bus in Atlantic City (Atlantic County), a 73-year-old man who died from hypothermia after failing to evacuate in Brigantine (Atlantic County), a 93-year-old man who fell and struck his head while moving a car in Ventnor (Atlantic County), a 73-year-old man and his 70-year-old wife from a generator related house fire in Willingboro (Burlington County), a 69-year-old woman who was ran over by a municipal truck clearing debris in Sea Isle City (Cape May County), a male in Bethlehem Township (Hunterdon County) who also was struck and killed by a vehicle clearing debris, a 79-year-old male in Lambertville (Hunterdon County) who fell down and struck his head, a 59-year-old woman in Trenton (Mercer County) who died of carbon monoxide poisoning, two 55-year-old males in Edison and New Brunswick (Middlesex County) who both died of carbon monoxide poisoning, an 84-year-old woman who fell down stairs in Middlesex (Middlesex County), a 55-year-old male and 78-year-old woman in Middlesex (Middlesex County) who both died from smoke inhalation from a house fire started by candles, a 40-year-old male in North Brunswick (Middlesex County) who was struck and killed by a weakened tree on November 4th, a 61-year-old male who died of hypothermia after failing to evacuate in Long Branch (Monmouth County), a 94-year-old woman who died of hypothermia in Forked River (Ocean County), a 71-year-old male who died of hypothermia on Oakwood Drive in Stafford Township (Ocean County) and a 61-year-old male in Brick Township (Ocean County) who died after a tree stump fell on him as he was trying to remove it.|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|Prior to Sandy���s arrival, Governor Chris Christie called for voluntary evacuations of barrier communities on the 26th. The Governor declared a State of Emergency on the 27th and ordered a mandatory evacuation of all barrier island communities. Approximately 115,000 people were ordered to evacuate and 15,000 people were in shelters. More than 2,000 National Guard troops were deployed. Tolls along sections of the Garden State Parkway and all of the Westbound Atlantic City Expressway were suspended. On the 28th, the day before Sandy���s landfall, all gaming activity at the Atlantic City casinos ceased and the properties were closed. President Barack Obama signed a federal emergency declaration for New Jersey. Tolls along the entire northbound length of the Garden State Parkway were suspended. All State Parks and Historic Sites were closed. Late that afternoon, New Jersey transit began a gradual system-wide shutdown. On the 29th, the evening of Sandy���s landfall, PATCO suspended commuter rail service between Philadelphia and southern New Jersey. All bridges across the lower Delaware River to and around Philadelphia were closed. Approximately 130 miles of the Garden State Parkway was closed from Woodbridge in Middlesex County to its terminus in Cape May County. The New Jersey Turnpike was closed in central New Jersey. Most schools were closed. The nuclear power plants at Oyster Creek (Ocean County) and Salem (Salem County) suspended operations because of tidal flooding. On the 30th, the day after Sandy���s landfall, all 580 school districts in the state were closed. All courts and state offices were closed. Over 200 roadways were closed. Numerous boil water advisories were issued for the northern and coastal parts of the state, some that lasted into November. Atlantic City International Airport reopened on the 30th. Governor Chris Christie postponed Halloween in the state until November 5th. On October 31st, two days after Sandy���s landfall Amtrak started limited rail service. State offices were still closed, but some schools reopened. Most major roadways away from the immediate coast including the New Jersey Turnpike were reopened. On November 1st, three days after Sandy���s landfall Governor Christie rescinded evacuation orders for some of the Atlantic County barrier islands. The River Line Transit service between Camden and Trenton resumed. New Jersey Transit bus service resumed as did the Cape May-Lewes Ferry.  On November 2nd, the governor lifted the evacuation order for Atlantic City and the casinos opened the next day. Evacuation orders were also lifted for Cape May County. Limited New Jersey Rail Service resumed. Because of power outages, lines for gas reached 100 cars long in the northern part of the state. The governor declared a limited state of emergency and imposed odd-even rationing for gasoline purchases in twelve northern New Jersey counties because of the shortages. They remained in effect through November 12th. The Environmental Protection Agency temporarily suspended some Clean Air Act restrictions. The entire state was also under odd-even water restrictions. On November 3rd, about 75 major roadways were still closed.  On November 4th, rail service between Philadelphia and Atlantic City resumed. It was estimated that the average New Jersey beach became 30 to 40 feet narrower. It was difficult for people whose homes were uninhabitable to find rental properties.  ||Sandy produced record breaking outages, in the state, 2.7 million utility customers lost power, by far surpassing the record from Tropical Storm Irene in 2011. Public Service Electric and Gas alone had power lost to 1.4 million of its customers in the state, twice the number of its customers impacted by Irene. The utility reported about 48,000 trees had to be removed or trimmed to restore power and over 2,400 poles had to be replaced. Both were two to three times the impact from Irene. Jersey Central Power and Light estimated that nearly 1.0 million of its customers lost power, about ninety percent of its customer base.  This included hardest hit areas of Ocean and Monmouth Counties.  Monmouth County had the greatest number of sustained outages of any county in the state. The utility had to cut through approximately 45,000 fallen trees. It was unable to restore power to about 30,000 of its shore and barrier island customers because of massive infrastructure damage to those homes and businesses. Atlantic City Electric reported about 208,000 of its customers lost power.  Atlantic City Electric restored all power to its customers by November 6th. Elsewhere in the state, power restoration was hampered by a nor���easter that occurred on November 7th. Public Service Electric and Gas restored all power on November 12th and Jersey Central Power and Light by November 14th.  ||The unique aspect of Sandy and unlike most tropical systems was the multi-tide cycle increase of onshore winds prior to landfall. This caused multiple high tide cycles with tidal flooding and also helped produce catastrophic wave action. Record breaking or near record breaking high tides were exacerbated by the high astronomical spring tides associated with the full moon. Recording breaking high tides would have occurred regardless of the lunar tidal cycle in northern New Jersey. Sandy���s landfall coincided closely with the high tide cycle on the evening of the 29th. On the oceanside, Raritan Bay and the lower Delaware Bay, minor tidal flooding started during the high tide cycle on the morning of the 28th, with some moderate tidal flooding during the high tide cycle on the evening of the 28th. Widespread major tidal flooding occurred during the morning and evening high tide cycles on the 29th. The highest tide (and surge) along the ocean front and Raritan Bay was with the landfalling high tide cycle on the evening of the 29th. The ocean front and Raritan Bay surge was 5 to 9 feet. A new all time record tide was set in Sandy Hook (Monmouth County). The tide reached 13.31 feet above mean lower low water before the pier collapsed about 45 minutes before high tide. An after the event survey performed by the USGS and Rutgers University determined that an estimated crest of 14.40 feet above mean lower low water will be used as the new record for Sandy Hook. The entrance to New York Harbor Buoy (a relatively new buoy) had record breaking seas of 32.5 feet. The Delaware Bay Buoy (about 19 miles east of Fenwick Island, Delaware) had seas that reached 24.5 feet. It was estimated that waves likely reached 12 to 24 feet along the ocean front with the largest waves along Monmouth County.  Most of the surveyed damage to barrier island homes that were either destroyed or moved indicated that it was the storm surge and wave action that caused most of the damage. Either minor or no tidal flooding occurred with the subsequent high tide cycles the rest of the month.||In Upper Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River, some minor tidal flooding occurred during the evening high tide cycle on the 28th, moderate (upper Delaware Bay) and major (the tidal Delaware River) record breaking tidal flooding occurred during the one overnight high tide cycle on the 29th as Sandy moved westward. The storm surge averaged 4 to 5 feet. The Admiral Wilson Boulevard in Camden was flooded and closed. The region was spared higher surges as Sandy made landfall in New Jersey and the winds prior to landfall pushed water down the Delaware River and Delaware Bay. Borderline minor to moderate tidal flooding occurred during the subsequent daytime high tide cycle on the 30th. Minor tidal flooding occurred along tidal sections of the Delaware with the high tide cycle on the 31st. Tidal sections of the Delaware River were spared significant runoff from the non-tidal sections of the river as the heaviest rain occurred in the southern half of New Jersey.||Strong north to northeast winds associated with Sandy started to spread across the state during the morning of the 29th from the southeast and east coast northwestward throughout the state. High or damaging winds started during the middle of the morning along coastal Ocean County. Highs winds started to occur across the rest of the southeast part of the state during the afternoon of the 29th and spread into the northern part of the state by the evening of the 29th. The southwest part of the state was affected the least by the high winds. Most of the peak wind gusts (between 70 mph and 91 mph) occurred during the late afternoon and evening hours as Sandy was making landfall. Most of the high winds in the state were over by Midnight EDT that night and as Sandy rapidly weakened, most of the strong wind gusts were also over by 6 a.m. EDT on the 30th. The highest measured wind gust in Mount Holly���s forecast and warning area was 91 mph in Atlantic City (Atlantic County) at 355 p.m. EDT on the 29th. The most widespread measured hurricane force wind gusts occurred in northern Ocean County and in Monmouth County.||Heavy rain also occurred with Sandy. This made it easier for shallow rooted and leafed trees to be uprooted, it also complicated the tidal flooding. Unlike some of the more recent tropical systems to affect the area, the heaviest rain was not in the northern half of the state. Event rainfall totals averaged 1 to 3 inches in the northern half of the state and 3 to 7 inches in the southern half of the state, except 6 to 12 inches along the southern tier counties of Salem, Cumberland, Cape May County as well as coastal Atlantic County. The steady rain associated with Sandy spread into the southeast part of the state during the day on the 28th and slowly edged north. The rain spread into the central and southwest part of the state overnight on the 28th and spread into the northwest part of the state during the morning of the 29th. The heaviest rain fell overnight on the 27th into the early evening of the 29th in the southeast part of the state and during the daylight hours on the 29th in the central and southwest part of the state. The rain ended during the middle of the day on the 30th throughout most of the state, but lingered into the evening in the southwest part of the state.|\t\t\t\t\t|Some county by county information is included in the ensuing paragraphs.  They are in alphabetical order for the sixteen counties under Mount Holly���s forecast area in the state. Inland flooding event information is listed separately.  \t\t||In Atlantic County, the northern end of the famed Atlantic City boardwalk was destroyed. That part was planned on being removed. The wind damaged boardwalks within the city. The city was cut off from the mainland by tidal flooding after the morning high tide. Elsewhere in the county, heavy tidal damage was reported in Longport, Margate and Ventnor.  Nearly every municipality from Egg Harbor and Galloway Townships eastward suffered widespread wind and or tide damage. ||In Burlington County, a Mount Holly resident was trapped inside their home after a tree landed on it. Indicative of tree damage in the county, seven roadways were closed in Medford Township. Along the Delaware River, tidal flooding occurred in the Columbus Park Development along the Assiscunk Creek in Burlington City. The most widespread damage (mainly tidal and flood related) was reported in Bass River Township. In Camden County, about 70 large trees had to be removed from roadways. In Cherry Hill Township alone, twenty-four streets were closed. In Camden City, tidal flooding inundated Admiral Wilson Boulevard (U.S. Route 30) and Delaware Avenue. Rutgers University Camden Campus was closed until the 31st.||In Cape May County, nearly every municipality suffered widespread damage. The Ocean City Boardwalk was damaged, but survived. Ocean City and most of the barrier islands were also cut off after the morning high tide on the 29th.  The wave action was so severe that the Ocean City-Longport (Atlantic County) Bridge was closed because boulders were pushed onto it. In Cumberland County, Gandy���s Beach, Money Island and Fortescue were all evacuated because of Delaware Bay flooding. The most widespread damage in the county occurred in the eastern municipalities of Commercial, Downe and Maurice River Townships. In Gloucester County, the majority of the reported damage was flooding related. ||In Hunterdon County, the roof was blown off an airport hanger in Alexandria Township. Nearly 90 percent of the county lost power. In Mercer County, the roof of Alexander Elementary School in Hamilton Township suffered wind damage. An abandoned building in Trenton partially collapsed. Thirteen major roadways in the county were closed including U.S. Route 206 and the New Jersey Turnpike. Over 100 homes were damaged by fallen trees. ||In Middlesex County, the worst reported damage occurred in Woodbridge Township, Sayreville, South River and Old Bridge Townships. Most of this was related to tidal flooding in Raritan Bay and its ripple effects on the inland rivers including the Raritan. Mandatory evacuations occurred along the Raritan Bay and as far west along the Raritan River as New Brunswick. In Perth Amboy, evacuations included Water Street residents. Tidal flooding occurred in both Perth Amboy and Sayreville. A 336,000 gallon diesel fuel spill into Raritan Bay occurred in Perth Amboy.  Both the Veterans Bridge and Morgan Bridge were closed in Sayreville. In Old Bridge, evacuations occurred east of New Jersey State Route 35 and included Cliffwood and Laurence Harbor. All of New Brunswick lost power and because of water supply issues Rutgers University canceled classes for the entire week.  Homes were damaged by downed trees in Old Bridge and East Brunswick. In Morris County, nearly 90 percent of the county lost power. In Denville alone, 180 trees were knocked down.||Monmouth and Ocean Counties suffered the greatest damage from Sandy. Every municipality that bordered Raritan Bay and the Atlantic Ocean suffered widespread damage in Monmouth County and every inland municipality had at least some sporadic damage. Union Beach and Sea Bright were among the most hardest hit locations. In Sea Bright, many businesses were totally destroyed and the fishing pier collapsed. Both Spring Lake and Belmar had miles of their boardwalks destroyed. Some schools were damaged beyond use. Monmouth University was used as an evacuation center. The New Jersey Transit line will have to be rebuilt because it was severely damaged. Ferry service between Manhattan and Atlantic Highlands was suspended indefinitely. Miraculously the only Sandy related injury was carbon monoxide poisoning in Middletown.  Like Monmouth County, in Ocean County, every municipality in the eastern half of the county suffered widespread damage. The two amusement piers that collapsed into the ocean along with the rides in Seaside Heights became the iconic symbols of damage along the Jersey Shore. Roofs of homes collapsed in Seaside Heights. The wave and tide action created a new inlet in Mantoloking and swept homes away. Houses were literally pushed off their foundation. Bay Head, Point Pleasant and Mantoloking were all devastated. The rupture of natural gas lines caused additional damage as house fires occurred in Mantoloking. Mantoloking was the last municipality to permit residents to move back. This was not permitted until late February of 2013. Damage progressively increased as one moved south along Long Beach Island south of New Jersey State Route 72 through Holgate. Tidal flooding affected houses on the west side of Barnegat Bay. The two drownings in the county occurred on the mainland. The Oyster Creek Nuclear Power plant in Forked River shut down because of flooding. It reopened on the 30th. Major flooding occurred as far west as Toms River.   ||In Salem County, tidal flooding climbed the walls of Riverview Beach Park in Pennsville Township. Some voluntary evacuations occurred in the township. Tidal flooding caused an automatic shutdown of the Salem Nuclear Power Plant after four of its six pumps failed. In Somerset County, sporadic wind damage was reported mainly in the southern two-thirds of the county. Both Sussex and Warren Counties suffered relatively less damage than counties farther to the east. The largest issue was fallen trees.  The only township to report widespread damage was Walpack Township in Sussex County.||Peak wind gusts included 91 mph in Atlantic City (Atlantic County), 88 mph in Tuckerton (Ocean County), 87 mph at Sandy Hook (Monmouth County), 79 mph in Sea Girt (Monmouth County), Barnegat Light (Ocean County) and High Point (Sussex County), 78 mph in Brick Township (Ocean County),  75 mph in West Cape May (Cape May County), Harvey Cedars (Ocean County), Long Branch (Monmouth County) and Sussex (Sussex County), 74 mph in Pittstown (Hunterdon County) and Point Pleasant (Ocean County), 73 mph in Monmouth Beach (Monmouth County), 71 mph in Lakehurst (Ocean County) and Seaside Heights (Ocean County), 70 mph in Florence (Burlington County), Parsippany (Morris County), Perth Amboy (Middlesex County) and Cape May (Cape May County), 69 mph in Teetertown (Hunterdon County) and Wantage (Sussex County), 68 mph in Trenton (Mercer County), Stewartsville (Warren County) and Toms River (Ocean County), 66 mph in Absecon (Atlantic County), Cream Ridge (Monmouth County) and at the McGuire Air Force Base (Burlington County), 65 mph in Berkeley Township (Ocean County), 64 mph at the Atlantic City International Airport (Atlantic County) , 61 mph in Basking Ridge (Somerset County), Wall Township (Monmouth County) and Pequest (Warren County), 60 mph in Lumberton (Burlington County) and Ocean City (Cape May County), 56 mph in Woodland Township (Burlington County), 55 mph in Mercerville (Mercer County) and Somerville (Somerset County), 53 mph in Washington Township (Gloucester County) and 49 mph in Sicklerville (Camden County).||Maximum sustained winds included 68 mph at Sandy Hook (Monmouth County) and 61 mph at the Cape May Ferry Terminal (Cape May County) and Long Branch (Monmouth County), 60 mph in Bay Head (Ocean County) and 51 mph in Atlantic City (Atlantic County).||The highest tide reached a record breaking 13.31 feet above mean lower low water in Sandy Hook (Monmouth County) before the pier collapsed approximately 45 minutes before the evening high tide on the 29th. The previous record was above mean lower low water in Philadelphia. The previous record was 10.1 feet above mean lower low water during Hurricane Donna on September 12, 1960 and the December 11, 1992 nor���easter. In Atlantic City (Atlantic County), the highest tide reached 8.9 feet above mean lower low water during the evening high tide on the 29th. This was the second highest tide on record, the highest was 9.0 feet above mean lower low water on December 11, 1992. In Cape May, the highest tide reached a record breaking 8.91 feet above mean lower low water during the morning high tide on the 29th. The previous record was 8.8 feet above mean lower low water during Hurricane Gloria on September 27, 1985. Traveling up the Delaware Bay and into the tidal Delaware River, the high tide at Reedy Point (New Castle County) reached 9.1 feet above mean lower low water during the evening high tide on the 29th. It was the second highest tide on record, the record is 9.2 feet above mean lower low water set during the April 16, 2011 nor���easter. In Philadelphia, the overnight high tide on the 29th reached a record breaking 10.62 feet above mean lower low water. The previous record was 10.5 feet above mean lower low water during a pair of nor���easters: April 17, 2011 and November 25, 1950.||While there are no established benchmarks for tidal flooding levels at these other stations, the following is a list of the highest tides during Sandy. These may not represent the highest actual tide as there were power outages and some of the graphs plateaued at high crest. The tide gages whose peak crest looks suspect (and may be higher) are marked with an asterisk. At South Amboy* (Middlesex County), the highest crest was 9.0 feet above mean lower low water, at Keansburg* (Monmouth County), the highest crest was 8.96 feet above mean lower low water, at Sea Bright (Monmouth County), the highest crest was 13.79 feet above mean lower low water, at Belmar* (Monmouth County), the highest crest was 8.70 feet above mean lower low water, at Mantaloking (Ocean County), the highest crest was 6.99 feet above mean lower low water, at Barnegat Light (Ocean County), the highest crest was 6.54 feet above mean lower low water, at Ship Bottom* (Ocean County), the highest crest was 5.24 feet above mean lower low water, at Tuckerton* (Ocean County), the highest crest was 8.26 feet above mean lower low water, at Sea Isle City* (Cape May County), the highest crest was 7.94 feet above mean lower low water, at Stone Harbor* (Cape May County), the highest crest was 8.50 feet above mean lower low water, at North Wildwood (Cape May County), the highest crest was 7.65 feet above mean lower low water, at Cape May Harbor (Cape May County), the highest crest was 8.67 feet above mean lower low water, at Burlington* (Burlington County), the highest crest was 11.66 feet above mean lower low water and at Newbold Island (Bucks County), the highest crest was 12.27 feet above mean lower low water.","Hurricane Maria was a catastrophic category 4 hurricane which devastated the island of Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. Maximum sustained winds of 175 mph as it was approaching the county warning area. The direction was towards the west northwest with the eye clipping Saint Croix and Vieques. The hurricane then made landfall in the municipality of Yabucoa in mainland PR at 6:15 am AST with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph. The center of the storm traversed diagonally through mainland Puerto Rico exiting across the northwest municipalities in the early afternoon hours. Extreme winds  were observed across most of mainland Puerto Rico, Vieques, and Saint Croix with catastrophic flooding observed across many areas in mainland Puerto Rico.||During a preliminary survey of areas along the path of Hurricane Maria���s center, it was evident that catastrophic damage had occurred. Maria���s strong winds spread large amounts of debris across the entire area. All full trees were defoliated, and those that were not, were snapped or uprooted by Maria���s strong winds and lost medium to large branches. During the interview process, stories and images were particularly similar. Numerous locals reported that they felt the ground and their houses shaking, while most were amazed by the force of the unprecedented strong winds that not only transformed their surroundings but also their lives. Although most structures across the island are built using concrete as the main material, countless homes and buildings sustained some type of structural damage. If not blown off, non-concrete roofs suffered some type of damage. Nearly all commercial signs, fences, and canopies were destroyed, including large digital high definition boards. The last time that Puerto Rico experienced a category 4 or stronger hurricane was back on 1928 with Hurricane San Felipe II.  Maria was the strongest hurricane to make landfall in mainland Puerto Rico since Hurricane Felipe II in 1928, a category 5 storm. |The NOAA estimate of damage in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands due to Maria is 90 billion dollars.||Death toll from hurricane Maria at the moment of this report is highly uncertain. The official number stands at 65 deaths. 20 of these deaths occurred during the hurricane. The other 45 deaths occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane. From these 45 deaths, there were four (4) people which died due to heart attack,  three (3) due to lack of respiratory aid and three more (3) people due to lack of medical supplies. In addition two (2) deaths were due to suicides. One person (1) died when a tree fell over his car while driving. As of late November 2017, there were three (3) confirmed deaths from leptospirosis. One person (1) died during hurricane preparations. One women (1) died when she fell from her wheel chair. Her house was flooded, and she drowned.|The reasons of the remainder of the deaths are unknown at the moment of this publication.","Hurricane Katrina was one of the strongest and most destructive hurricanes on record to impact the coast of the United States.  It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating.. Detailed information on the deaths, locations, and indirect or direct fatalities will be described in updates to Storm Data. Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  A university portable weather unit measured the lowest pressure of 920.2 mb near Buras around 0616 AM AM CDT on Aug 29th. with 934 mb being measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell at 938 AM CDT. The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell. Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.   Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 7 to 14 inches with lower amounts observed farther west toward the Atchafalaya River.  A rainfall total of 11.63 inches was measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell.","The eye of Hurricane Ike moved ashore in Galveston County near the city of Galveston. At landfall, Ike had a central pressure of 951.6 mb, as measured at Galveston Pleasure Pier, and a maximum estimated storm surge of 17 feet over portions of Chambers County and the Bolivar Peninsula. Maximum sustained winds at landfall were estimated at 95 knots (110 mph) with gusts to 110 knots (127 mph). A ship near the coast recorded a wind gust of 105 knots as the eye came through. At landfall, Ike was a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale based on wind speed, but due to its large size, had a storm surge more typical of a category 3 or 4. The height of the storm tide ranged from 4 to 6 feet in Matagorda county, 6 to 9 feet in Brazoria county, 10 to 13 feet along most of Galveston Island and Galveston Bay, to as high as 17 feet over portions of the Bolivar Peninsula and Chambers County. The majority of property damage at the coast was a result of storm tide. ||Collectively, damage amounts are estimated to be near 14 billion dollars over the counties of Harris, Chambers, Galveston, Liberty, Polk, Matagorda, Brazoria, Fort Bend, San Jacinto, and Montgomery with an estimated 8 billion of that due to storm surge in coastal Galveston, Harris and Chambers Counties. Fresh water flooding also occurred near the city of Houston where up to 14 inches of rain fell over a two day period, first from Ike, then from a line of thunderstorms associated with a cold front moving through the following day. The number of fatalities directly related to Ike was 12 in the aforementioned counties with 11 of those occurring in Galveston County from drowning due to the storm surge. In addition, there were at least 25 fatalities indirectly related to Ike, either due to carbon monoxide poisoning from generators, accidents while clearing debris, or house fires from candles. There were no known tornadoes associated with Ike.","Storm surge damage across coastal Mississippi was catastrophic and approached or exceeded the surge associated with Hurricane Camille and impacted a much more extensive area.  Almost total destruction was observed along the immediate coast in Hancock and Harrison Counties with storm surge damage extending north along bays and bayous to Interstate Highway 10 in some instances.  Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed by the storm surge. Most tide gages were destroyed by the storm surge so storm surge was determined primarily by post storm high water mark surveys conducted by FEMA. An estimated storm surge of approximately 23.0 feet occurred at the Hancock County EOC operations area in Waveland, and the high water mark measured on the Jackson County EOC building in Pascagoula was 16.1 feet.  Preliminary estimates of storm surge along the Mississippi Coast include Hancock County 19-25 ft, Harrison County 19-25 feet, Jackson County 17-21 ft. Wave action on top of the storm surge enhanced the damage in many area.  All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.","Wilma was a classic October hurricane which struck South Florida as a Category 3 hurricane on October 24th, 2005. Wilma developed from a tropical depression near Jamaica, a typical source region for October tropical cyclones, on the afternoon of October 15, 2005. It became the 21st named storm of the season during the morning hours of October 17, 2005, which tied the record for the most named storms in one season originally set back in 1933. Wilma underwent a rapid intensification cycle which began on October 18th and ended in the early morning hours of October 19th, with a central pressure decrease of an incredible 88 mb in only 12 hours!  The central pressure reached 882 mb, making Wilma the most intense hurricane ever in the Atlantic Basin, a full 6 mb lower than Hurricane Gilbert in September 1988. Wilma went on to make landfall on Cozumel Island just off the Yucatan Peninsula as a strong category 4 hurricane on Friday, October 21st, then drifted erratically over the Yucatan Peninsula through Saturday evening October 22nd.   Wilma began to move off the northeast coast of the Yucatan Peninsula on the night of the 22nd, then gradually accelerated northeast over the southern Gulf of Mexico toward South Florida as a strong mid and upper-level trough over the central United States moved south and forced a southwesterly steering flow. The hurricane made landfall as a category 3 storm shortly before 7 AM Monday, October 24th on the southwest Florida coast between Everglades City and Cape Romano with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph and an estimated minimum central pressure of 950 mb.   Wilma exhibited a very large 55 to 65 mile-wide eye while crossing the state, and the eye covered large portions of South Florida, including the eastern two-thirds of Collier County, extreme northwestern Miami-Dade County, the southern and eastern third of Hendry County, most of Broward County, and all of Palm Beach County. The eye also clipped the southeastern shore of Lake Okeechobee. The eye wall, the part of the storm with the strongest winds, affected virtually all of South Florida.  Around 10:30 AM, a South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) meteorological station located at the south end of Lake Okeechobee reported sustained winds of 103 mph. Sustained hurricane force winds (74 mph or greater) were observed over all areas except Hendry and Glades counties, and even those two counties measured hurricane force gusts.  The highest recorded gusts were in the 100-120 mph range.  An interesting and revealing aspect of Wilma was the wind field in the eye wall.  The winds on the back (south/west) side of the eye wall were as strong, if not stronger, than those on the front (north/east) side. This goes against the common, but sometimes erroneous, belief that the strongest winds in a hurricane are always in the right-front quadrant of the storm. This occurred over much of South Florida, except for central and southern Miami-Dade County which barely missed the southwestern portion of the eye wall, and likely contributed to the heavier damage across Broward and Palm Beach counties compared to slightly lesser damage across much of Miami-Dade and Collier counties.     Wilma moved rapidly northeast across the state, with an average forward speed of 25 mph. Wilma exited the east coast over northeastern Palm Beach County near Palm Beach Gardens around 11 AM Monday October 24th as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of around 105 mph.  It traversed the southern peninsula in about 4 hours. Rainfall amounts across South Florida generally ranged from 2 to 4 inches across southern sections of the peninsula to 4 to 6 inches across western Collier county and around Lake Okeechobee, with a maximum amount of 7.31 inches in Clewiston.  The maximum storm surge across the area was mostly south of Chokoloskee in Mainland Monroe county where a storm surge of 13 to 18 feet was forecast. Chokoloskee experienced a storm surge of around 7 feet, which caused extensive flooding. A storm surge of around 8 feet was estimated in Marco Island, with 4 feet in Everglades City. The southeast coast didn't escape the effects of the storm surge, with the tide gauge in Virginia Key reported a maximum surge of around 4 feet. Minor surge flooding was noted in Coconut Grove, Downtown Miami, and Northeast Miami.  In Collier, Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties, the winds killed a total of 5 people. Total damage estimates from all the effects range from $9 to $12 billion. Extensive damage to crops was reported, with an estimated $222 million in crop damage for Miami-Dade County alone.  Damage was widespread, with large trees and power lines down virtually everywhere, causing over 3 million customers to lose power. Structural damage was heaviest in Broward and Palm Beach counties where roof damage and downed or split power poles were noted in some areas. High-rise buildings suffered considerable damage, mainly in the form of broken windows. This was observed mainly along the southeast metro areas, but also in Naples, which underscores the higher wind speeds with height commonly observed in hurricanes.   One confirmed tornado was observed in rural Collier County around 2:30 AM on the 24th, moving rapidly northwest from the intersection of U.S. 41 and State Road 29 to the town of Copeland three miles to the north. An F1 intensity was assigned to the tornado as it caused snapped power poles, uprooted large trees, and significantly damaged mobile homes. Small swaths of greater damage elsewhere in South Florida have not been attributed to tornadoes, but were instead likely caused by  \"mini-swirls\", small vortices within the eye wall that have been observed in previous strong hurricanes such as Hurricane Andrew in 1992.","Hurricane Katrina was one of the strongest and most destructive hurricanes on record to impact the coast of the United States.  It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.Damage across coastal Mississippi was catastrophic.  The storm surge associated with Hurricane Katrina approached or exceeded the surge associated with Hurricane Camille and impacted a much more extensive area.  Almost total destruction was observed along the immediate coast in Hancock and Harrison Counties with storm surge damage extending north along bays and bayous to Interstate 10.  Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed by the storm surge. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, signage,  downed tress, and some windows were broken by wind and wind driven debris In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines.  Damage was less extensive in southwest Mississippi.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Mississippi were estimated at 9.8 billion dollars. Uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars across the Gulf Coast.As of late October the following fatality figures were reported in the Mississippi coastal counties; Hancock- 52, Harrison - 83, Jackson - 17. Additional details on fatalities will be given in later updates to storm data.Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  The lowest pressure on the Mississippi coast was estimated to be 928 mb where the hurricane made landfall near the Louisiana Mississippi border. A pressure of 976 mb was recorded at 0951 CDT by a university weather station deployed in Pascagoula, well east of the landfall location.  At approximately the same time, the pressure at the NWS office in Slidell, just to the west of landfall location, recorded a pressure of 934.1 mb at 0938 AM CDT. The highest wind gusts recorded in Mississippi and the adjacent coastal waters were 117 knots (134 mph) at the Pearl River County EOC office in Poplarville and 102 knots (118 mph) at 1000AM CDT by a university wind tower deployed at the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County.  Maximum sustained winds in Mississippi were estimated around 105 knots (121 mph) near the storm's second landfall along the Mississippi and Louisiana border.  Unofficial wind observations before the gage failed included a wind gust of 106 kt, (122 mph) at 0615 CDT by an amateur radio operator in Long Beach and a wind gust of 108 kt (124 mph) at the EOC in Pascagoula. Most tide gages were destroyed by the storm surge so storm surge was determined primarily by post storm high water mark surveys conducted by FEMA. An estimated storm surge of approximately 23.0 feet occurred at the Hancock County EOC operations area in Waveland, and the high water mark measured on the Jackson County EOC building in Pascagoula was 16.1 feet.  Preliminary estimates of storm surge along the Mississippi Coast include Hancock County 19-25 ft, Harrison County 19-25 feet, Jackson County 17-21 ft. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 10 to 16 inches across coastal and south Mississippi with much lower amounts observed over southwest Mississippi. The highest observed storm total rainfall was 11 inches at Stennis Space Center and near Picayune.","A slow moving low pressure system brought widespread showers and thunderstorms to the area. The system tapped into deep tropical moisture resulting in very intense rainfall across a large portion of the area. Two-day rainfall totals of 10 inches or more were common across areas generally to the west and northwest of Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas. The heaviest rainfall occurred across a swath of East Baton Rouge, Livingston, and St. Helena Parishes, where 20 to 30 inches fell over a 48-hour period, topping the 0.1% annual exceedance probability. The heavy rainfall led to widespread flash flooding and record river flooding. Many of the broken records had been set during the flooding of April 1983. In total, 12 people died in southeast Louisiana as a result of the flooding. The event was also responsible for an estimated total of ten billion dollars in damage across southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi. This estimate includes impacts of both the initial flash flooding and the resultant river flooding."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>EPISODE_ID<\/th>\n      <th>DAMAGE_PROPERTY<\/th>\n      <th>EPISODE_NARRATIVE<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Large wildfires such as the King Fire required large scale and very expensive suppression efforts. |For the entire state of California, 2014 was the warmest on record, which further increased the need for water and reduced an already limited snow pack. The Sierra snow pack ended the year at only about half of normal levels.|The California Department of Food and Agriculture���s Office of Public Relations summarized 2014 California agricultural losses: Direct costs to agriculture total $1.5 billion (revenue losses of $1 billion and $0.5 billion in additional pumping costs). This net revenue loss is about 3 percent of the state���s total agricultural value. The total statewide economic cost of the 2014 drought is $2.2 billion. The loss of 17,100 seasonal and part-time jobs related to agriculture represents 3.8 percent of farm unemployment. About 428,000 acres, or 5 percent, of irrigated cropland went out of production in the Central Valley, Central Coast and Southern California due to the drought.|The UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences research suggests that northern interior California lost 4115 to 6796 agricultural jobs in 2014. Almond production dropped by 15 percent compared to the 2013. Almonds are the largest crop for the region.",null,null,null,null,"Average to above average precipitation continued across the South Plains, the extreme southern Panhandle, and the Rolling Plains in November resulting in improving soil moisture conditions during the month.  However, the effects of this year's drought became better understood after year-end agricultural reports were completed.  These reports, compiled by the Texas Agricultural Extension Service at Texas A&amp;M University, indicated that total crop damage across the Texas South Plains area may have been about $515 million due to the drought in 2000.  This figure is based on the total cash value of all crops in 2000, compared to the average of the same figure from 1998 and 1999.Cotton is the dominant crop in this region of the state, and not surprisingly, it accounted for roughly 70 percent ($365 million) of the losses this year.  Significant losses were also suffered in the wheat ($75 million), grain sorghum ($40 million), and corn ($15 million) crops.  Added irrigation costs that were directly related to the drought were estimated at an additional $20 million across the South Plains area this year.",null,"Governor Ridge declared a drought emergency in 55 of the 67 counties of Pennsylvania following extended dry weather through much of the summer.  Water usage was restricted.  Precipitation deficits for many counties for the months of May through July averaged between 5 and 7 inches.  Precipitation departures for the 365 day period ending in mid-July were over 1 foot below normal in many places.  This is about one-third of total annual normal precipitation in most areas.  Streams were empty, wells dried up, and the Susquehanna River hit record low flows.  Hot sunny days combined with the dry weather to take a large toll on crops.  Preliminary estimates by the Department of Agriculture indicated possible crop losses in excess of $500 million.  The figure did not include a 20% decrease in milk production due to the drought that would also result in million dollar losses.  There were some counties that experienced 70 to 100% crop loss.

Temperatures warmed sharply the last few days of June.  The heat persisted into July.  Temperatures for the month of July were among the warmest on record.  In Des Moines, the monthly mean temperature was the second highest of record, only eclipsed by July of 1936.  Rainfall was in short supply across the state.  Much of the state recorded less than 50% of normal rainfall for the month, with a few locations under 10% of normal.  In addition, extended periods of temperatures above 95 F resulted in problems with pollination of the crops.  Rapid deterioration of the corn and soybean crop took place with several periods of temperatures in excess of 100 degrees.  By the end of the month, officials estimated that 20% of the crop yield had been lost to the drought.  At the current price, the loss total was in excess of $2.25 billion.  As of 31 July, the USDA reported that Secretarial Primary Drought Designations had been listed for 21 counties in the Des Moines CWA, with 11 receiving Contiguous Designation.  The primary counties were Butler, Bremer, Hamilton, Hardin, Grundy, Black Hawk, Boone, Story, Marshall, Tama, Polk, Jasper, Poweshiek, Marion, Mahaska, Lucas, Monroe, Wapello, Wayne, Appanoose, and Davis.  Contiguous counties included Wright, Franklin, Webster, Greene, Dallas, Madison, Warren, Clarke, Taylor, Ringgold, and Taylor.  The drought conditions continued into August.","Hurricane Katrina will likely go down as the worst and costliest natural disaster in United States history. The amount of destruction, the cost of damaged property/agriculture and the large loss of life across the affected region has been overwhelming. Catastrophic damage was widespread across a large portion of the Gulf Coast region. The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal.Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1.The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages.The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph).The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille.The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread. Damage occurred across all of the Jackson forecast area which includes 9 parishes in Northeast Louisiana, 2 counties in Southeast Arkansas and about 2/3 of Central and Southern Mississippi. As widespread as the damage was, the more concentrated and most significant damage occurred across Southeast and East-Central Mississippi. For other areas, especially those west of a Natchez to Yazoo City to Grenada line, damage to trees and power lines was significant and scattered across the landscape. As you move toward Central Mississippi and along Interstate 55 the damage and impacts increase. This portion of the state sustained widespread damage to trees and power lines. Millions of trees were uprooted, snapped or severely damaged. It was the fallen trees that caused just about all of the structural damage and downed power lines across this region. Hundreds of trees fell onto homes causing minor to major damage. These downed trees were responsible for 2 fatalities across Hinds and Warren counties. In each case, a tree fell on a house. Additionally, significant and extensive damage occurred to the Agriculture and Forestry industries of this region. The most devastating damage occurred across Southeast Mississippi, especially south and east of a Columbia to Collins to Laurel line. This region received sustained winds between 60 and 80 mph with gusts ranging from 80 to 120 mph. Wind damage to structures was widespread as many roofs were blown off or partially pealed off. Hundreds of signs were shredded or blown down. Many businesses sustained structural damage as windows were broken, roofs were blown off and walls were collapsed. Millions of trees were uprooted and snapped. Power poles and lines were snapped and taken down from wind and trees. It was the thousands of downed trees which caused the most significant structural damage as these trees fell onto homes and businesses. Ten fatalities were caused by trees falling on homes or on people in Jones county. This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees. Three fatalities occurred across Simpson, Lauderdale and Leake counties. Each of these fatalities was from fallen trees. The agricultural industry again was severely hit across this region with the biggest losses in the timber and poultry industries.The utility companies across the region were severely hit as well. Thousands of power poles and countless miles of power lines were taken down by fallen trees and wind. The power outages across the region were widespread and lasted for a period of a few days to as long as 4 weeks. An example of how widespread the power outages were can be shown from the Jackson Metro area which includes 3 counties, Hinds, Rankin and Madison. The first night, Monday night, the Metro had 97% of the area out of power. The most extensive outages were across the southeast and in rural areas. Here, power took 2-4 weeks to be restored due to the massive amount of damage.The agriculture and forestry industries of the state were severely effected by Hurricane Katrina. The timber industry was hit the hardest with timberland damaged estimated around 1.3 billion dollars. The devastating impact to this industry will be felt for decades. Another particularly hard hit industry was the poultry industry. In the region where the hurricane passed, about 9000 chicken houses exist and hold 20-25 thousand birds apiece. Approximately, 300 of these houses were destroyed and nearly another 2400 were damaged. The combination of lost birds and damaged houses bring damage estimates between 100-120 million dollars. The region's Row Crops were hard hit as well. The main crops in this industry are cotton, rice, corn and soybeans. The damage varied and was dependant on location. The estimated damage is around 100 million dollars. The region's catfish industry was also hard hit. The main damage has come from damaged levees and the loss of power. The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million).Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect. All the direct deaths, in some way, were attributed to fallen trees. Trees either fell on homes, on vehicles, or on the actual person. The indirect fatalities varied and ranged from heart attacks to heat stress during the days after without power.Damage costs associated with this hurricane will be the highest for any natural disaster in United States history. Preliminary amounts, across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area (CWA), show property damage estimates around 5.9 Billion dollars. Agricultural damage across the region was also extremely high with estimates around 1.5 Billion dollars. The total estimated damage is approximately 7.4 Billion dollars. All of these estimates are extremely preliminary and will likely be adjusted over the coming months.","On January 17th, 2014, Governor Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency for the entire state of California. The drought continued through the year 2014 with well below normal precipitation, though there were brief periods of relief in February/March and December from heavy rains. Exceptional drought was reported by the U.S. Drought Monitor by the end of July for all of Interior Northern California, with the most impacted area being the Northern San Joaquin Valley.","Exceptional (D4) drought conditions continued to persist across the entire South Plains, Rolling Plains, and southern Texas Panhandle regions. June, on average, is among the wettest periods of the year for the Southern Plains. However, June 2011 saw deepening rainfall deficits with a spring thunderstorm season failing to develop. Zero percent of normal rainfall was observed over a large part of the region. Only a few stations have recorded over two inches of rainfall on the year with Paducah the only site recording over three inches of rainfall. No measurable rainfall fell at Lubbock International Airport which is only the second time in 100 years of record that has occurred. Most of the area measured between 10 and 25 percent of normal annual rainfall.||The historic drought was made worse by a June heat wave. A very strong upper level high settled over the region in early June resulting in record heat. Many cities around the region recorded the warmest month on record. Temperatures throughout the month of June averaged between 8 to 11 degrees above normal. The city of Paducah had a maximum temperature of 118 degrees on June 26th tying its all time record high. This was two degrees behind the all-time record high for the state of Texas. Childress also tied their all time record high temperature of 117 degrees on June 26th. Keetch-Byram Drought Index values ranged between 600 and 800 across the region by the end of June. Strong winds with afternoon relative humidities often below 10 percent lead to many days with extreme fire weather concerns.||The drought's impact on wildfire activity continued into June with several wildfires initiated by dry high-based thunderstorms. This wildfire activity extended beyond the region's climatological wildfire season which typically subsides with seasonal green-up in April and May. Nearly 60,000 acres of land were burned by wildfires within the Lubbock CWA (County Warning Area) during the month of June. Agricultural impacts accelerated across the region as farmers struggled to irrigate dry fields. All crops were becoming a major loss by the end of June and were severely impacting the local economy. Local farmers were able to begin the insurance claims process for failed crops during the month, and livestock losses continued to grow with growing shortages of water and feed.||Economic losses for the year due to drought through June, 2011 were estimated near $1.5 billion.","Heavy rainfall during the month of June caused considerable crop losses across the state.  Crop damage was done through a combination of inundation flooding and losses due to crops not being able to be planted or rotting in the ground.  It is not possible to get a clear breakdown of the percent of damage that can be attributed to each cause.  The damage here is not related to the river flooding.  Those flooding events are addressed in other flooding entries.  Many of the southern Iowa counties were unable to plant crops at all through June, while areas of the central and north lost the crops that were planted through drowning or washouts.  Estimates from the state and county extension offices indicated that about 10% of the crop was lost across the state.  The amount of loss in the DMX CWA was around $1 billion to the corn and soybean crop.  By the end of the month, Iowa Governor Culver declared 32 counties state disaster areas.  They were Black Hawk, Buena Vista, Butler, Cherokee, Clay, Davis, Decatur, Emmet, Franklin, Hamilton, Hancock, Howard, Humboldt, Jasper, Jefferson, Kossuth, Lee, Lyon, Mahaska, Madison, Marion, Monroe, O'Brien, Osceola, Palo Alto, Polk, Ringgold, Sioux, Shelby, Taylor, Union, Van Buren, Wapello, Warren, Webster, Wright.  An application for about 35 counties was made for a Presidential Disaster Declaration.","Drought conditions continued across north Texas as precipitation deficits increased.  This month, all of north Texas was classified in either extreme drought (D3) or exceptional drought (D4) as classified by the U.S. Drought Monitor.  Every county in north Texas was eligible for federal disaster relief due to the drought.  The weather continued to be unseasonable warm.  The average high temperature this January was 68.3 degrees, a full 14.2 degrees above normal.  This figure broke an 83-year-old record.  Wildfires continued to be a major problem in January, with a burn ban in place in every county.  A quarter of a million acres burned across Texas in the first half of the month, more than during all of 2005.  The ongoing drought combined with strong winds and low humidities to create a volatile fire situation in Texas.  On New Year's Day, several devastating wildfires erupted across north Texas.  Forty homes were destroyed in Montague County as a 17-mile long fire burned between Ringgold and Nocona.  Another grass fire in Johnson County burned 13 buildings and charred 1,800 acres.  In Eastland County, a fire encompassing more than 35,000 acres forced the evacuations of several communities and destroyed the city of Kokomo.  Thirty-six buildings were lost in the fire.  Several firefighters and civilians suffered burns, smoke inhalation, and heat exhaustion due to the fires.Hydrological and agricultural impacts worsened over the past month due to the lack of rainfall.  Most water reservoirs across north Texas were 60% to 85% of normal capacity.  Several lakes across the region were 10 to 15 feet below normal pool elevation.  The North Texas Municipal Water District implemented watering restrictions earlier than normal this year due to the lowering lake levels.  Watering restrictions were also in effect on a voluntary basis in some cities. The Texas Cooperative Extension estimated agricultural losses for north Texas to be close to $1 billion in January.  Only half of the state's hay crop was fit for harvesting, and hay prices were three to four times their normal price.  Many other crops failed to grow at all.  Agricultural groups appealed for federal grants to aid the cattle industry.  One emergency measure considered by the federal government included providing cash to ranchers to offset high feed costs and losses due to the drought and wildfires. A drought summit was held in San Antonio to discuss the crisis. The drought was also affecting wildlife in north Texas.  The Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife reported an overall decline in habitat conditions, and noted that the lack of green plants would affect the survival rate of certain animals.","Extreme (D3) to Exceptional (D4) drought conditions that had been ongoing across central and southeast Illinois since June eased significantly during the month of September.  Remnants of Hurricane Issac brought widespread rain totals of 2 to 4 inches from September 1st through 3rd.  This was followed by additional rainfall throughout the month that resulted in much of the area being downgraded to the Moderate Drought category (D1) or better.  Eight west-central Illinois counties along and northwest of a Marshall to Lincoln line remained in the Severe Drought category (D2) through the end of the month. Total crop losses from the extended drought across central and southeast Illinois was estimated to be $1.2 billion.","Serious drought conditions gripped the state through the summer months.  Initial sub-soil moisture was good at the beginning of the growing season.  The recharged soil was sufficient to maintain the crops through a good part of the summer.  Rainfall remained low through August as well and crops deteriorated rapidly under the warmer than normal and very dry conditions.  Rainfall for the summer was between 1/3 and 2/3rds of normal across much of the Des Moines CWA.  A large part of the CWA received under 5% of normal rainfall in August, with most areas under 20%.  Crop loss through the month was around 10%.  This translated to over $600 million in crop loss for the corn crop, and about $350 million for soybeans.","The 2017 growing season began early across Upstate South Carolina, due to an unusually warm February and early March that saw average temperatures of almost 10 degrees above normal. An episode of cold arctic high pressure in the middle of March led to a hard freeze on the morning of the 16th, when low temperatures in the lower to mid 20s were reported. This devastated the peach crop across the Upstate, with crop losses estimated at 80-90%. Other crops were damaged as well. While subsequent days of freezing temperatures caused further damage, the vast majority of the damage occurred on the 16th.","During the month of June, the drought peaked across the region. It held firm across the same areas since May with no expansion. What did expand was the severity as by the end of June, most of Central and East-Central Mississippi was now in extreme drought (D3) with some locations across Northeast Mississippi now experiencing exceptional drought (D4). The month of June did not offer much rain as most of the forecast area saw less than 40% of the normal rainfall. If you would go back to the start of the drought, the portion of the forecast area under the drought has only seen 5 to 20% of the annual rainfall. Historical climate sites are running some 15 to 20 inches below normal for rainfall with deficits now higher than the yearly total.| |With the drought conditions reaching extreme levels, area farmers and crops began feeling the effects. Many crops from corn to soybeans have been affected with yields forecast to be much less than normal by harvest time. The quality of the crops has been affected as well due to the dry conditions. The total losses will not be fully know until fall after harvest."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>EPISODE_ID<\/th>\n      <th>DAMAGE_CROPS<\/th>\n      <th>EPISODE_NARRATIVE<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script> <br> <br>

taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the

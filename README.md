## NCDC Storm Events

This project is in continuation of a project assignment I took in *Reproducible Research* offered through [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org) via Johns Hopkins University. 

This project does *not* provide solutions to that programming assignment. It is merely an effort to perform data collection, cleaning and analysis with a very large dataset. However, one may be able to get a better idea on handling that dataset or similarly large datasets. 

Data files will not be hosted in this repository due to the size. To reproduce any analysis or perform your own, you are welcome to download the scripts. 

### Codebook

The most recent codebook and naming conventions can be found on the [Storm Events Database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp) website.

### Nomenclature

* files are verbs to describe a dataset, function or group of functions contained within, or the analysis. Names are seperated by hyphens and generally will not extend beyond fiften characters.

> sample-file.R

* functions are verbs to describe the function. Names are seperated by underscore characters.

> sample_function()

* variables are nouns and follow the function naming structure.

> sample_var

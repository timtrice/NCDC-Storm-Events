## NCDC Storm Events

This project is in continuation of a project assignment I took in *Reproducible Research* offered through [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org) via Johns Hopkins University. 

This project does *not* provide solutions to that programming assignment. It is merely an effort to perform data collection, cleaning and analysis with a very large dataset. However, one may be able to get a better idea on handling that dataset or similarly large datasets. 

Data files will not be hosted in this repository due to the size. To reproduce any analysis or perform your own, you are welcome to download the scripts. 

### Codebook

The most recent codebook and naming conventions can be found on the [Storm Events Database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp) website.

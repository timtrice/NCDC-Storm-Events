## Analysis of Files

We access `get_listings` so we have all of the datasets available by `Year`, `Type` and `Size`:

```{r}
ds_list <- get_listings()
```

Next, we need to decide what datasets we want to evaluate. First, let's see exactly what we're dealing with:

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.cap = "Details, Fatalities and Locations by Year, Size"}
library(ggplot2)

base_plot <- list( 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()), 
    facet_grid(Type ~ ., scales = "free_y"), 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)), 
    scale_fill_discrete(name = "Type"), 
    xlab("Year"))

ggplot(ds_list, aes(x = factor(Year), y = Size, fill = factor(Type))) + 
    scale_y_continuous(label = function(x){x * 10^-6}) + 
    ggtitle("Details, Fatalities and Locations by Year, Size") + 
    ylab("Size (MB)") + 
    base_plot
```

**Note the y-axis has been set to free scales for each `Type`.**

Obviously, as we get intot he more recent years our datasets get largers; particularly *details*. This is why you should be careful requesting multiple years. Our fatalities isn't quite as large (a good thing) topping out around a very small 15kb (and that's an outlier). 

We can also see we don't have *locations* until 1996. 

It might seem like we have no *details* datasets prior to 1957. However, this is not correct; it's merely the scale of the later years dominating our graph. 

Let's look at the data between 1950 and 1995:

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.cap = "Details, Fatalities and Locations by Year (1950-1995), Size"}
tmp <- ds_list[Year <= 1995,]

ggplot(tmp, aes(x = factor(Year), y = Size, fill = factor(Type))) + 
    scale_y_continuous(label = function(x){x * 10^-3}) + 
    ggtitle("Details, Fatalities and Locations by Year (1950-1995), Size") + 
    ylab("Size (KB)") + 
    base_plot
```

Notice I've dropped the scale from MB to KB now.

Now we can see a bit clearly our early *details* datasets and yes, they are there. 

But, now we have all *locations* datasets the same size? Seems odd. These are, in fact, empty. These files contain only the header row. So, there really is no sense pulling them unless you want a bunch of empty data tables. 

## Requesting Data

If I just want to see the *details* for 1950, I first want to see the total file size of the data I'm requesting:

```{r}
year <- 1950
type <- "details"

x <- ds_list[Year == year & Type == type, Size]
```

Just pulling this one dataset is 'r formatC(x, format = "d", big.mark = ",")'b or approximately `r formatC(x*10^-3, format = "d", big.mark = ",")`kb. This is for a *gzip* file (all of the datasets are gzip). So the file size will be a bit larger; in this case though, it shouldn't be much.

So, this isn't bad at all
